### Description
Multiple Monitor Background allows you (would you believe it) to set separate wallpaper for each of your displays either set a single background across all displays. Currently it's working with Windows only.

### To do
- single wallpaper mode is currently doesn't use information of displays positioning. I'm going to finish this on first demand. Still it's possible to achieve the same result with usual Windows personalization setting.
- add Linux support
